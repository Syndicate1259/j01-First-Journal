Descriptive title
"By line" with your name and the date of the journal entry
Image(s) or videos to help illustrate your narrative of the interaction
A narrative that describes your user experience with technology. It should include your goals, a description of the interaction, and the outcome.  
You should assess the user experience in terms of concepts taught in class and/or the most relevant UX goals: effective, efficient, safe, satisfying, learnable, memorable, useful, error tolerant.  
When any of the terms are used in your narrative, you should highlight them in bold and provide a description in your own words. Each journal entry should have at least one unique term that is described (not already in a previous journal entry). 
The assessment of the interaction can be nuanced, acknowledging any strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for how the weaknesses can be addressed will make for a particularly strong journal entry.
The writing style should resemble a relatively informal style of blogs. The entries should also communicate to a broad audience, who do not necessarily know UX terminology, so make sure to describe things in a way most people can understand.
